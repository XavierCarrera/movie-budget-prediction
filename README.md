<h2> About this project: </h2>

This repository is my project for the [Applied Maching Learning Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/scikit/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description : </h2>

Using Sickit Learn, we analyze a dataset from IMBD. In this way, we take variables such as ratings, popularity and revenue to predict the budget for any given movie. The machine learning algorithms implemented were:

- Decision Tree
- K Neariest Neighbour
- Random Forests
